      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>
        A <b>variable</b> is an identifier (name) binded to a location in memory that stores a typed value,
        governed by scope, lifetime and contextually exhibits mutability or immutability. <i>Declaration</i> specifies
        the type of data a variable may store, at which point, the variable may be <i>assigned</i> data (that complies
        with the type of the variable). Variables may have their contents and behavioural characteristics explicitly and
        contextually modified and altered, permitting safe (or unsafe), efficacious and free usage (without compromising
        static typing).
      </p>
      <p>
        To utilize a variable in Java, it must be <b>declared</b>, then <b>initialized</b> (or <b>instantiated</b>).

        In variable declaration, the <b>data type</b>, then the <b>identifier</b> (or <b>name</b>) of the variable is
        specified. The name of the variable allows it to be called elsewhere within a program, whilst the type of the
        variable (a facet of <i>strong typing</i>) determines the type of data it can store. Then, in variable
        initialization, the identified (named) variable is assigned some value compatiable with the type of the
        variable. Similarly, in variable instantiation, the named variable creates a new object.

        Note, however, that an <i>instance</i> (<i>field</i>) or <i>static</i> variable that is declared yet not
        initialized is automatically assigned its <i>default value</i> by the JVM. However, <i>local</i> variables are
        not useable without initialization or instantiation.

        Additionally, depending on the mutability of the variable or of its type, it may be reassigned a value else
        within a program at runtime.
      </p>

      <pre class="language-java"><code>
        /* Main.java */
        class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
            int var1; // Declared as an int variable named 'var1'
            Object var2; // Declared as an object variable named 'var2' 
            /* 
            Both 'var1' and 'var2' are automatically assigned '0' and 'null', respectively.
            Uninitialized instance or static variables compile without error.               
            However, as 'var1' and 'var2' are, in practice, identical to:
              
                int var1 = 0;
                Object var2 = null;            

            Certain methods may cause compilation or runtime errors. 
            For example, 'var2.toString()' will throw a 'NullPointerException' at runtime.   */
            var1 = 10; // 'var1' is initialized; its name used to assign 'var1' an int value of '10'
            var2 = new Object(); // 'var2' instantiates an generic Object object.
            
            System.out.println(var1); // Prints '10' to console.
            System.out.println(var2.toString()); // Prints a String representation of an object, typically specified in 'toString()'
          }

          void String toString() {
            /* Implementation not shown */
          }

          void method(int parameter) { // Method 'method' requires an integer parameter, a local int variable named 'parameter'.
            /* Implementation not shown */

      <h2>Data Types</h2>
      <p>
        A <b>data type</b> is a technical categorization of <i>data</i> (to clarify, <i>data</i> concerns any and all
        information stored on a computer represented as symbols, such as a 'bit' or a 'b', which represent binary
        digits) that affects its interpretation by a computer. Thus, the data type of a variable dictates the type of
        storable data.
      </p>
      <p>
        There exist two broad categories of data types: <b>primitive</b> and <b>reference</b>. Primitive data types
        represent numerical, logical or lexicographical data, which are fundamental classifications of data which the
        JVM already recognizes. Reference data types store pointers and memory addresses that refer to data, which may
        be user-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variables <i>store</i> data by allocating enough <i>stack</i> or <i>heap</i> memory to allocate the size of the
        data. Primitive data may be allocated in either stack (if declared within a <i>method</i>) or heap (if declared
        within an <i>object</i>) and have no inherent <i>overhead</i> (that is additional memory required to accomodate
        data). Reference data is always allocated in heap memory (to perserve memory allocated for a particular object)
        and require overhead.
      </p>

        <h3>Primitive Data Types: Integers, Floating-Point Values and <code>strictfp</code></h3>
        <p>
          In Java, there are four informal subclassifications of primitive data types: integers, floating-point numbers
          (FP numbers), characters and boolean algebra. All integers and FP numbers are inherently <i>signed</i>. In
          fact, both the maximum and minimum (inclusive) ranges of an integer in Java and an FP number (according to
          IEEE 754-2019) are calculatable given the size of a particular type in <i>bits</i>. Also calculable, Java
          supports <b>subnormal</b> (or <i>denormal</i> according to various standards documents) which more smoothly
          graduates <i>underflow</i> (a resultant more precise than the computer architecture is capable of supporting).
        </p>
        <p>
          Like many other languages, Java utilizes <i>two's complement</i> to represent signed integers, including the
          signed range of integer data types and is responsible for integer arithemtic. Currently, Java utilizes
          floating-point arithmetic (as specified in IEEE 754-2019) to handle floating-point values.
        </p>
        <p>
          In relation to FP values, the <code>strictfp</code> keyword enforces compliance of <i>IEEE 754-1985</i>.
          Historically, CPUs utilized varying precisions for registers, with some CPUs (particuarly x86, Intel x87,
          etc.) utilizing extended precision registers (80 bits). Before Java SE 1.2, floating-point semantics were
          enforced by default. However, this standard was relaxed until Java SE 15, requiring the use of the keyword.
          Otherwise, the JVM was permitted to use extended precision for intermediate calculations, causing minor
          variations between platforms. Java SE 16 (JEP 306) reimplemented strict floating-point semantics by default.
          Thus, <code>strictfp</code> keyword is currently retained solely for legacy code and backward compatibility.
          Still, since its usage for 22 years, the keyword remains a point of intrigue when discussing FP values.

    <h2>Data Type</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Data type</b> specifies the nature of the data that a variable may store, directly determining which
      operations may be logically performed on variables and permits safe, reliable handling.
    </p>

    <!-- h3: Primitive Data Types -->
    <h3>Primitive Data Types</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>primitive data type</b> is a representation of the most fundamental forms of data typically supported by
      Java, including: Integers; rational and irrational numbers; Unicode characters and boolean logic.
      Primitive data types are immutable, variables assigned primitive data store required bits rather than an address,
      pertains to no method and are typically stored in stack memory (if not a field of an object or a class).

      <br>

      Java utilizes <i>two's complement</i>, <i>IEEE 754</i> and <i>UTF-16</i> to standardize the handling of various
      types of primitive data (except for boolean logic, which is reliant on context of its implementation).
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Two's complement: Responsible for the signage, range and arithmetic of integers and handles pertinant
        exceptions and errors.</li>
      <li>IEEE 754: Responsible for the signage, range and arithmetic of <i>floating-point values</i> (or <i>decimal
          values</i>); including positive and negative zeros and infinities, and denormalized and subnormal numbers.
      </li>
      <li>UTF-16: Supports all valid code points in Unicode, including the BMP and supports low and high surrogacy.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>


    Integers have a simple construction: a <i>sign bit</i> that controls signage (1 for negative integers; 0 for
    positive integers) followed by the rest of the bits (perhaps best referred to as the <i>integer body</i>, as there
    is no standardized terminology).

    To represent rational and irrational numbers, Java utilizes <i>IEEE Std. 754</i>, which defines formats for
    <i>single-precision</i> and <i>double-precision</i> numbers, floating-point arithmetic, denormalized and subnormal
    numbers and handles exceptional cases (Nan; positive and negative zeros; and positive and negative infinities).



    Floating-point values are more complicated: A <i>sign bit</i>, <i>exponent</i> bits that determine the magnitude
    of a floating-point value and <i>signficiand</i> (or <i>mantissa</i>) bits that are the signficiant digits of the
    floating-point value.

    <h4>Integers: Byte, Short, Int and Long</h4>
    <p>
      Two's complement efficiently makes possible: Addition, subtraction (technically, addition of a negative value) and
      negation.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-non">Addition [a + b] and subtraction [a + (-b)]:
        00000101  =  5
      + 11111100  = -4
      -----------
        00000001  =  1

      Negation (~a + 1):
       ~00000101 = 11111010
      +        1
      -----------
        11111011  = -5</code></pre>

    <p>
      <i>Signage</i> is a critical facet of two's complement, as it permits bit-fixed arithmetic.
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-non">Addition [a + b] and subtraction [a + (-b)]:
        00000101  =  5
      + 11111100  = -4
      -----------
        00000001  =  1

      Negation (~a + 1):
       ~00000101 =   11111010
                   +        1
                   ----------
                     11111011  = -5</code></pre>
    <p>
      All two's complement integers exhibit a <i>range</i>: The inclusive span between a minimum and maximum value.
      The range is grossly dependant on signage as the <i>sign bit</i> (a bit that determines whether an integer is
      positive or negative by being 0 or 1) is also the <i>most significant bit</i> (the leftmost bit), as approximately
      half of all positive values are negated in a signed integer. Likewise, an unsigned integer will always have a
      minimum value of 0, as the most-significant bit then behaves identically to any other bit.

      In fact, the formulas for calculating the range of a signed and unsigned n-bit integer are:

      Signed integers: -2<sup>n-1</sup> to 2<sup>n-1</sup>-1
      Unsigned integers: 0 to 2<sup>n</sup>-1

      For example, if n = 8:

    <p>
      A <b>byte</b> is an 8-bit, two's complement signed integer, with an inclusive range of -2<sup>7</sup>
      (-128) to 2<sup>8</sup>-1 (+127).<br><br>

      Bitmasking (with caveats and precautions per integer type) can reinterpret signed integer types as unsigned
      values.
      Since Java 8, there has been support for unsigned arithmetic for <code>int</code> and <code>long</code> values (in
      the <code>Integer</code> and <code>Long</code> wrapper classes).

      A properly bitmasked byte simulates an inclusive range of 0 to 2<sup>8</sup>-1 (+255).

      To properly utilize a variable, it must <i>declared</i>, then <i>initialized</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Declaration and Initialization</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Declaration</b> specifies the <i>data type</i> and <i>name</i> of a variable;

    There are eight primitive data types in Java:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>byte</i>, <i>short</i>, <i>int</i> and <i>long</i> represent integer values</li>
    <li><i>float</i> and <i>double</i> represent floating points</li>
