    <h1>Control Flow</h1>

    <!-- h2: Conditionals -->
    <h2>Conditionals</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>conditional</b> evalutes some expression (the <i>condition</i>) and executes a particular block
      of code depending on the result of the evaluation.
      Conditionals are the foundation of control flow; they allow a program to make decisions based on the current state
      of the program.<br>
      Conditional statements (<code>if</code>, <code>if else</code>, <code>else</code>), switch statements
      (<code>switch</code>) and iteration statements (<code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>do while</code>) all
      rely on conditionals.
    </p>

    <!-- if (true) -->
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">if (true) {
        System.out.println("This code block will always execute.");
      }
      /* This is the most elementary example of a conditional.                   */
      /* The conditional statement (if) evalutes the literal expression (true).  */
      /* As the condition is true (perpetually), the code block always executes. */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- h2: Conditional Statements -->
    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>conditional statement</b> is a statement that evaluates a boolean expression and executes a block
      of code if the expression is true.
    </p>

    <!-- if-then -->
    <p>
      The most basic conditional statement is the <i><code>if</code> statement</i>.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int num = 5;
      if (num > 0) {
        System.out.println("The number is positive.");
      }
      /* As num is an integer values greater than 0, the code block executes.                                            */
      /* If num was lesser than 0, then the code block would not execute, effectively skipping the statement altogether. */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- if-else -->
    <p>
      The <code>else</code> statement provides a default code block to execute if the boolean expression is false.
      It only executes if all prior conditional statements are false, terminating all further evalutations.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int num = -5;
      if (num > 0){
        System.out.println("The number is positive.");
      } else {
        System.out.println("The number is negative.");
      }
      /* As num is an integer value lesser than 0, the second code block executes.                     */
      /* If num was greater than 0, then the first code block would execute, and the second would not. */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- if-else-if -->
    <p>
      The <code>else if</code> statement provides an alternative (not default) code block to execute if prior
      conditional statements are false.
      Yet, it allows for further evaluation past itself (if its boolean expression is false) until the else statement.
      It functions identically to another conditional statement placed within an else statement (of the initial
      conditional statement), acting as a systanic construct that chains multiple conditions under a single conditional
      statement.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int num = -5;
      if (num > 0){
        System.out.println("The number is positive.");
      } else if (num < 0) {
        System.out.println("The number is negative.");
      } else {
        System.out.println("The number is zero.");
      } 
      /* As num was less than 0, the second code block executes.        */
      /* If num was greater than 0, the first code block would execute. */
      /* Likewise, if num was 0, the third code block would executes.   */

      if (num > 0){
        System.out.println("The number is positive.");
      } else {
        if (num < 0) {
          System.out.println("The number is negative.");
        } else {
          System.out.println("The number is zero.");
        }
      }
      /* This code block is functionally identical to the previous code block. */</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The <code>else if</code> statement is not required to have an <code>else</code> statement, though it is
      reccommended, as it provides a default code block to execute if all prior conditional statements are false.
    </p>

    <!-- h2: Switch Statements/Expressions -->
    <h2>Switch Statements (case n:) and Expressions (case n ->)</h2>

    <!-- case n: -->
    <p>
      A <b>switch statement</b> is a statement that equates cases to a single conditional.
      The <code>switch</code> keyword evaluates only one conditional before attempting to equate the evaluation to a
      matching <code>case</code>.
      If a matching case exists, then there exist three methods in executing the code block:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>break</code>: This jump statement terminates the case, preventing fall-through.</li>
      <li><code>return</code>: Another jump statement, this also terminates the case (eliminating the need for a break
        statement).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If no matching case exists, then <code>default</code> is executed as a terminating case.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">String week = "WEEKEND";
      switch (week) {
        case "WEEKEND":
          return "Yay! It's the weekend!";
          break;
        case "WEEKDAY":
          return "Ugh... it's a weekday.";
          break;
        default:
          return "Uh oh. We've broken the space-time continuum.";
          break;
      }
      /* The condition week (assigned a String value of "WEEKEND") is equated to the case "WEEKEND" and the first code block executes. */
      /* If week was assigned a value of "WEEKDAY", the second code block would execute.                                               */
      /* If week was assigned any other String value, then the third code block would execute.                                         */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- case n -> -->
    <p>
      A <b>switch expression</b> (made available since Java 14) may appear syntactically comparable to a
      switch statement.
      Only, instead of serving an explicit function, a switch expression computes and returns a value (as it is an
      expression, not a statement).
      It must be assigned to a type and variable (e.g. <code>String label = switch (x) {...}</code>) or immediately used
      (<code>return switch (x) {...}</code>).
      Additionally, a switch expression uses <code>-></code>, called <i>switch rule arrow</i> (uses the arrow token;
      unrelated to the lambda: <code>-></code>).
      A <i>switch rule</i> (<code>case n -></code>) directly associates a case with the corresponding value, including
      <code>case null -></code> since Java 21 (assuming that the condition is is a type that accepts <code>null</code>).
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">String week = "WEEKEND";
      return switch (week) {
        case "WEEKEND" -> "Yay! It's the weekend!";
        case "WEEKDAY" -> "Ugh... it's a weekday.";
        case null -> "Not very talkative, eh?"
        default -> "Uh oh. We've broken the space-time continuum.";
      }
      /* The condition week is immediately matched with the first case, which returns the String value "Yay! It's the weekend!" */
      /* This is different than a switch statement, which would print the value instead as part of its function.                */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- h2: Iteration Statements -->
    <h2>Iteration Statements</h2>
    <p>
      An <b>iteration statement</b> (commonly referred to as a <b>loop</b>) is a statement that
      repeatedly evaluates an expression and executes code depending on the evaluation.
      If the condition is <code>true</code> (or <code>false</code>), then code is sequentially executed until the
      condition evalutes to a different logic value or encounters a jump statement (<code>break</code>,
      <code>continue</code> and <code>return</code>).
      Having a loop control variable is critical, as it formally verifies that the statement is properly behaved and
      inevitably terminates.
    </p>

    <!-- while -->
    <h3>While statement</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>while statement</b> or loop iterates until the condition evalutes to a dissatisfactory value,
      terminating and exiting the statement.
      Especially within a while loop, there must exist a jump statement or the loop control variable eventually
      dissatisfies the condition, terminating the statement.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int num = 0;
      while (num <= 10) {
        num++;
        return num;
      }
      /* The while statement iterates so long as num is lesser than or equal to 10.                                                        */
      /* The loop control variable num increases by increments of 1 per iteration until num is increases to 11, terminating the statement. */

      while (num >= 10) {
        num--;
      } // This while statement never executes, as num (equal to 0) immediately dissatisfies the condition.

      while (num <= 10) {
        num--;
      } // This while statement iterates indefinitely, as the condition is never dissatisfied.</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- do-while -->
    <h3>Do-while Statement</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>do-while statement</b> is a variation of the while statement.
      The statement iterates once (initially) without evaluating the condition; then, the statement behaves identically
      to a while statement.
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int num = 0;
      do {
        System.out.println("This code block always executes, regardless of the condition of the do-while statement.");
      } 
      while (num < 0) {
        System.out.println("The number remains negative.");
        num++;
      }
      /* The do keyword ensures that the first code block always executes, regardless of the value of num. */
      /* As num is greater than 0, the while loop does not iterate.                                        */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- for -->
    <h3>For Statements</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>for statement</b> iterates a specified number of times.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Statement (initialization): <b>int i = n1;</b> determines a value or index that the for statement
        starts iterating from.</li>
      <li>Condition: <b>i ∘ n2;</b> is some condition (comparison) that evalutes to some boolean value, either
        satisfying or disatisfying the for statement.</li>
      <li>Increment: <b>i∘∘</b> is some increment that alters the loop control variable (i) to eventually
        disatisfy the for statement.</li>
    </ol>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
        return i;

      /* The for statement starts at 0 and increases i by 1 per iteration while i lesser than or equal to 10. */

      int i = 0;
      while (i <= 10) {
        return i;
        i++;
      }
      /* This while statement is functionally identical to the for statement. */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- for-each -->
    <h3>For-each Statement</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>for-each statement</b> is a variation of the for statement exclusively used for arrays and lists
      (any object dependent on the <code>Iterable</code> interface).
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">for (int i : arr) {
        return i;
      } 
      /* Do note that no condition is explictly written, as the equivilent code: */

      Iterator<String> it = someList.iterator();
      while (it.hasNext()) {
        String item = it.next();
        // ...
      }
      /* has the condition it.hasNext(); summarized, the for-each statement checks if there is another element to retrieve. */</code>
    </pre>

    <!-- h2: Nested Statements -->
    <h3>Nested Statements</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Nested statements</b> are iteration statements where the iteration and execution of a statement
      (outer statement) explicitly encompasses another (inner statement).
      Each statement must utilize a unique statement control variable; errors concerning scope are thrown when a common
      loop control variable is shared between nested statements.
      Loop control variables are communicable by encompassment; the variable of the outer statement is accessible by
      inner statements, yet the inverse cannot occur.
      Efficient array traversal is completely dependent on properly nested statements (as unnecessary nesting impacts
      readibility and computational efficacy).
    </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
      <code class="language-java">int[][] matrix {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}};

        for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
          System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
        }
      }
      /* In row-major traversal, the inner statement iterates until j dissatisfies the condition, causing the outer statement to iterate once. */
      /* The inner statement may access both loop control variables; the outer statement (if it had) may only utilize i.                       */ </code>
    </pre>

    <!-- h2: Jump Statements -->
    <h2>Jump Statements</h2>
    <p>
      A <b>jump statement</b> predictably and reliably disrupts sequential execution, optimizing structured
      control flow.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>break</code>: Immediately terminates the current execution and jumps from the current code block to the
        nearest sequential executable or code block.</li>
      <li><code>continue</code>: Used with iteration statements, it immediately terminates the current execution and
        jumps back to the evaluation of the condition.</li>
      <li><code>return</code>: Immediately terminates the current execution and jumps out of the method entirely;
        optionally yielding a value.</li>
      <li><code>goto</code>: <i>Deprecated</i> to ensure structured programming; the keyword is still reserved from C.
      </li>

    <!-- h2: Exception-Based Control Flow -->
    <h2>Catching and Handling Exceptions (and Errors)</h2>
    <h3>try-catch-finally</h3>
    <p>
      There are three code blocks in Java concerned with catching and handling exceptions and errors.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>try</code>: Encloses executable code that may throw an exception (or error, though doing so will likely
        illicit damaging ramifications with proper precautions).</li>
      <li><code>catch</code>: A code block that handles a matching exception. Since Java 7, one code block may handle
        more than one exception, barring restrictions and with precautions.</li>
      <li><code>finally</code>: A code block that executes immediately after the <code>try</code> block terminates,
        ensuring code is executed, even if an unexpected or uncaught exception occurs.</li>
    </ul>
    <pre class="line-numbers">

    <h3>try-with-resources Statement</h3>
    <p>
      A <code>try</code><b>-with-resources statement</b> is a try block that declares one or more resources
