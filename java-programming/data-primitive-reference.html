    <h1>Data types</h1>
    <p>
      A <b>data type</b> is a technical categorization of <i>data</i> (to clarify, <i>data</i> concerns any and all
      information stored on a computer represented as symbols, such as a 'bit' or a 'b', which represent binary
      digits) that affects its interpretation by a computer. Thus, the data type of a variable dictates the type of
      storable data.
    </p>

    <h2>A brief overview of data types</h2>
    <p>
      The JVM recognizes two broad categories of data types: <b>primitive</b> types and <b>reference</b> types.
      Primitive data types represent numerical, logical or character data, which are fundamental classifications of data
      which critical protocols within the JVM inherently recognizes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a field is assigned to a value that is primitive data, the JVM allocates enough memory to directly store the
      size of the value in <i>stack memory</i>, which is unordered memory that prioritizes speed in recalling values
      over the ability to reliably store and keep data in a particular location: Not a concern for data that
      is as non-idiosyncratic as an integer number or a particular letter of the English alphabet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, if a field is assigned to reference data, the JVM merely allocates enough memory for the variable to
      store the address of the data in memory, largely because reference types are often significantly larger than
      primitive types and it would be impractical to store directly in stack memory. Thus, reference data is stored in
      <i>heap memory</i> instead, which can reliably retain data in an unchanging location.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a field, method or another structure is imbued with a particular type, whether a primitive or reference type,
      it cannot be explicitly altered. This particular <i>type system</i> is called <i>static typing</i>, where the data
      type of a field must be stated during declaration in source code and must be clear to the JVM during compilation
      (and before runtime).
    </p>

    <h2>Primitive data types</h2>
    <p>
      The JVM reserves eight keywords for primitive data, whereby each represents a differing interpretation of binary
      data. In fact, there can be established four informal classifications of primitive data: four keywords define
      integers (their formatting and arithmetic abiding by the <i>two's complement</i> standard), two keywords
      define real numbers (and other numbers, per the scientific standard <i>IEEE 754</i>), one defines characters
      (encoded in <i>UTF-16</i>) and the remaining keyword defines basic logic (true and false).
    </p>

    <h3>Primitive data types that represent integers</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Two's complement</i> is a common representation of integers using binary data (represented using 0s and 1s).
      If the bits of an integer were correctly laid out in a line, the leftmost bit would be the <i>most-significant
        bit</i> (MSB), which is the bit that has the greatest affect on the decimal value of the integer. In contrast,
      the rightmost bit would be the <i>least-significant bit</i> (LSB).
    </p>
    <p>
      In two's complement, the MSB is used to determine the <i>signage</i> (whether a number is positive, negative or
      neither) of an integer. If the MSB has a value of 0, then the integer is positive. Likewise, the integer is
      negative if the MSB has a value of 1.
    </p>
    <img src="java-diagrams/1010-example.svg" width="400" height="300">
    <p>
      The <i>range</i> (the least or greatest, negative or positive value that a number may be equal to, starting from
      0, which is neither negative nor positive) of a two's complement integer is calculable using the following
      formulas: min = -2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup> and max = 2<sup><i>n</i>-1</sup>-1, where <i>n</i> is the size of the
      integer measured in bits. The base of both formulas is <b>2</b>, as binary is a <i>base-2</i> (two possible
      values) representation of decimal numbers, which are base-10 (hence, why scientific notation uses a base of 10).
    </p>
    <p>
      However, as demonstrated by the two formulas above, the maximum value of an integer is 1 less than the absolute of
      the minimum value. This disparity is a result of the MSB being used for signage. As a value of 0 represents a
      positive number, the MSB cannot contribute to the decimal value for all positive numbers.

    <h3>Primitive data types that represent real numbers</h3>

    <p>
      <i>Floating-point arithmetic</i>, summarily, is arithmetic performed to determine the scientific notation of a
      real number, which from left to right includes: the <i>significand</i> (an integer or fractional that contains the
      significant digits of a number), the radix (or base; used to represent a number according to some system) and the
      exponent that the radix is raised to the power of.
    </p>
    <p>
      number = signficiant * base<sup>exponent</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>IEEE 754</i> is a technical norm that standardizes the formatting, rounding rules, operations and the handling
      of exceptions and errors of floating-point numbers&mdash; and is a widespread choice of implementation across
      hardware and software, including Java. The standard explicitly defines how 32-bit and 64-bit large FP numbers are
      formatted, which are commonly called <i>single-precision</i> and <i>double-precision</i> formats, respectively.
    </p>
    <img src="java-diagrams/fp32-example.svg" width="1200">
    <img src="java-diagrams/fp64-example.svg" width="1200">
    <p>
      These FP formats correspond directly to the two reserved keywords that represent real numbers: <code>float</code>
      and <code>double</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Approximating the minimum and maximum ranges of a floating-point value is more complicated a process than that of
      integers, as special values (such as <i>subnormal numbers</i>, which provide additional precision for extremely
      small or large numbers) and <i>bias</i> (an integer added to the exponent to permit representation of positive and
      negative numbers).
    </p>
    <p>
      The bias is subtracted from the original exponent to determine the exponent that performs the calculation. The
      bias of <code>float</code> is 127 and the bias of <code>double</code> is 1023. Thus, accounting for bias, the
      minimum and maximum values of either data type are provided below:
    </p>
    <p>
      Let: <br>
      - <i>f</i> = number of fraction bits<br>
      - <i>n</i> = number of exponent bits<br>
      - <b>bias</b> = 2<sup><i>n</i> - 1</sup> - 1<br>
      - <b>e<sub>min</sub></b> = 1 - bias<br>
      - <b>e<sub>max</sub></b> = (2<sup><i>n</i></sup> - 2) - bias<br><br>

      Then:<br>
      <b>min</b> = 1.0 * 2<sup>e<sub>min</sub></sup><br>
      <b>max</b> = (2 - 2<sup>-<i>f</i></sup>) * 2<sup>e<sub>max</sub></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>float (32-bit):</b><br>
      - <i>f</i> = 23, <i>n</i> = 8, bias = 127<br>
      - <b>e<sub>min_float</sub></b> = 1 - 127 = <b>-126</b><br>
      - <b>e<sub>max_float</sub></b> = (2<sup>8</sup> - 2) - 127 = 254 - 127 = <b>127</b><br>
      - <b>min<sub>float</sub></b> = 1.0 * 2<sup>-126</sup> ≈ 1.17549435 * 10<sup>-38</sup><br>
      - <b>max<sub>float</sub></b> = (2 - 2<sup>-23</sup>) * 2<sup>127</sup> ≈ 3.4028235 * 10<sup>38</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>double (64-bit):</b><br>
      - <i>f</i> = 52, <i>n</i> = 11, bias = 1023<br>
      - <b>e<sub>min_double</sub></b> = 1 - 1023 = <b>-1022</b><br>
      - <b>e<sub>max_double</sub></b> = (2<sup>11</sup> - 2) - 1023 = 2046 - 1023 = <b>1023</b><br>
      - <b>min<sub>double</sub></b> = 1.0 * 2<sup>-1022</sup> ≈ 2.2250738585072014 * 10<sup>-308</sup><br>
      - <b>max<sub>double</sub></b> = (2 - 2<sup>-52</sup>) * 2<sup>1023</sup> ≈ 1.7976931348623157 * 10<sup>308</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      The same as above, only now accounting for denormalized (subnormal) numbers, which provide greater precision for
      extremely small (close to 0) and extremely large numbers (approaching infinity).
    </p>
    <p>
      Let: <br>
      - <i>f</i> = number of fraction bits <br>
      - <i>bias</i> = exponent bias <br>
      - Subnormal numbers have an exponent of <b>1 - bias</b>, and the leading significand bit is <b>0</b> (not
      1)<br><br>

      Then:<br>
      <b>min<sub>sub</sub></b> = 2<sup>1 - bias - f</sup><br>
      <b>max<sub>sub</sub></b> = (1 - 2<sup>-f</sup>) * 2<sup>1 - bias</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>float (32-bit):</b><br>
      - <i>f</i> = 23, bias = 127<br>
      - <b>min<sub>sub_float</sub></b> = 2<sup>-126 - 23</sup> = 2<sup>-149</sup> &approx; 1.4 * 10<sup>-45</sup><br>
      - <b>max<sub>sub_float</sub></b> = (1 - 2<sup>-23</sup>) * 2<sup>-126</sup> &approx; 1.17549421 * 10<sup>-38</sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>double (64-bit):</b><br>
      - <i>f</i> = 52, bias = 1023<br>
      - <b>min<sub>sub_double</sub></b> = 2<sup>-1022 - 52</sup> = 2<sup>-1074</sup> &approx; 4.9 *
      10<sup>-324</sup><br>
      - <b>max<sub>sub_double</sub></b> = (1 - 2<sup>-52</sup>) * 2<sup>-1022</sup> &approx; 2.2250738585072010 *
      10<sup>-308</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, whilst being familiar with the limits of what a <code>float</code> or <code>double</code> value can store,
      it is perhaps more useful to understand to what <em>decimal precision</em> each type can represent a value. Each
      binary digit of a significand contributes log<sub>10</sub>(2), or approximately 0.30103 decimal digits to decimal
      precision. Thus, a <code>float</code> value is precise to 24 bits * 0.30103, or <b>7.22 decimal digits</b> and a
      <code>double</code> value is precise to 53 bits * 0.30103, or <b>15.95 decimal digits</b>.

      </tr>
    </table>

    <h3>Character data</h3>
    <p>
      The data type <code>char</code> can store any single <i>UTF-16 code unit</i>, which entirely accounts for the
      <i>Basic Multilingual Plane</i> (BMP), which includes 2^16, or 65,536 unique examples. Over 63,000 are assigned
      characters, such as: alphabetical characters, iconographic characters, mathematical operators, miscellaneous
      symbols and historic scripts. The rest are dedicated to non-character code points that are used for other encoding
      standards that Unicode (though, not necessarily <code>char</code> or Java) supports.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>char</code> also supports <i>escape sequences</i> (such as '\n', which returns a newline, or '\t', which
      represents a horizontal tab) and <i>Unicode code points</i>, which is a Unicode code point (such as 'U+0041') that
      is represented using ASCII code (which translates 'U+0041' into '65') and is then stored as a UTF-16 code unit
      (here, '0x0041').
    </p>

    <h3>Logic data</h3>
    <p>
      The data type <code>boolean</code> represents basic logic and can store one of two volumes: <code>true</code> or
      <code>false</code>. Technically, the size of a boolena value is 1 bit (as the binary digit '0' represents
      <code>false</code> and '1' to represent <code>true</code>), though the value is always <i>padded</i>
      (supplementary memory consumed to increase practicality and functionality) to convenience the JVM in finding the
      value within stack memory.
    </p>

    <h2>Literals and default literals</h2>
    <p>
      A <i>literal</i> is the technical term for the value assigned to a field and the value that a field stores. In
      Java, a field that is declared, yet not initialized, cannot remain unassigned a value. Yet, declaring an instance
      variable may be declared and not initialized immediately thereafter. Instead, the JVM recognizes the uninitialized
      instance variable and assigns it a <i>default literal</i>, which is performed covertly and requires no input from
      the programmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Below are the default literals of each type, assigned to each field&mdash; and fields, not instance variables, as
      whilst the latter may remain uninitialized, fields declared within methods must be initailized on the same line
      that they were declared upon:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-java">
      /**
      * All four keywords that represent integers share the same default literal: '0'
      *
      * Though 'long' values undercutting or exceeding the range of an 'int' value must be suffixed with the letter 'L'
      * Otherwise, the JVM assumes that the value assigned to a field of type 'long' is 'int', which will throw an error.
      */

      byte  varBy = 0;
      short varSh = 0;
      int   varIn = 0;
      long  varLo = 0L;  // The L is technically unnecessary until the value is lesser than -2^31 or greater than 2^31-1


      /**
      * 'float' and 'double' share the same default literal: 0.0
      *
      * Though 'float' values must be suffixed with the letter 'F' or 'f', regardless of its value.
      * Otheriwse, the JVM assumes that the value assigned to a field of type 'float' is 'double', which will throw and error.
      *
      * A 'double' value may be suffixed with the letter 'D' or 'd', though this is not mandatory.
      */

      float  varFl = 0.0f;  // The suffixed letter is always required to assigned a float value
      double varDo = 0.0d;   // The suffixed letter is not required in any circumstance other than for clarity
      
      /**
      * The default literal of 'char' is '\u0000' (represents Unicode code point 0, which is effectively a 'null' value)
      */

      char varCh1 = '\u0000';
      char varCh2 = 0;  // ASCII code does not have to be quoted in single quotation marks

      /**
      * The default literal of 'boolean' is 'false'
      */

      boolean varBo = false;
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Reference data types</h2>
    <p>
      The JVM does not necessarily reserve keywords in the same manner as it does for primitive data types. In fact,
      reference data is more accurately defined as a hierarchy of increasingly specific implementations of broad
      structures. The Java language, specifically the <i>Java Development Kit</i> (JDK) includes <i>libraries</i> and
      other collectives that contain large amount of classes are broadly related by purpose and functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Built-in</i> classes concern those included in libraries within the JDK, which define universal features that
      all developers use to program applications: <i>Strings</i>, <i>classes</i>, <i>arrays</i>, <i>interfaces</i>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>User-defined</i> data concerns reference data that is defined by the programmer (using the JDK), such as a
      custom class that defines the attributes and functionality of a spreadsheet in a financial application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, there exists an indefinite number of classes between those defined in the JDK and those by programmers, the
      list below includes general categorizations of reference data:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Classes</b>: Built-in and user-defined classes used to define attributes and behaviour</li>
      <li><b>Arrays</b>: Homogenous container objects that forms a list of elements</li>
      <li><b>Interfaces</b>: Abstract types that define a contract that implementing classes must adhere to</li>
      <li><b>Enumerations</b>: A specialized class representing a fixed set of constants</li>
      <li><b>Lambdas</b>: Permits <i>functional programming</i> in Java, a predominant <i>OOP</i> language</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      For the purposes of simplicity, only classes are mentioned here. However, the data structure above (including
      classes) are more extensively covered in dedicated webpages.
    </p>

    <h3>Universally used classes</h3>
    <p>
      There exists a hierarchy between classes (a concept called <i>inheritance</i>) where aspects of one class are
      provided to another. In Java, there are over 4500 classes and interfaces defined by and contained within the JDK.
      The <code>Object</code> class is the progenitor of all other built-in and user-defined classes, which are
      descendents of the class; some of which are used across nearly every Java application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples include:
    </p>
    <p>
      A <code>String</code> object is a sequence of <code>char</code> values that is <i>immutable</i>, whereby a field
      assigned a String object cannot be modified, only reassigned an entirely new String value.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>Math</code> class defines mathematical operations that utilize mathematical semantics (which, to note,
      the class does not define) to perform formulaic procedures in a concise, repeatable manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Wrapper classes</b> (such as <code>Integer</code> or <code>Double</code>) permit object representations of
      their respective primitive data type, which subsequently permits the utilization of methods previously incomptable
      with primitive data.
    </p>
    <p>
      An <code>Array</code> object is a type-homogenous list of elements that is a fixed size. Comparably, an <b>ArrayList</b>
      is a (largely) type-homogenous list of objects with a size that is variable at runtime.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="language-java">
      /**
      * Objects are often created using the 'new' keyword, though not always.
      */

      String varSt = new String;
